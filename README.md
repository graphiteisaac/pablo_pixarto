This is a really simple Discord bot made with [grom](https://gitlab.com/grom-gleam/grom) that 
checks Bluesky for new posts by the @pixeldailies.bsky.social account periodically, and posts them to the 
[Pixel Paradise](https://discord.gg/T7FKRGP2ZJ) server when they're found.

Thanks to [Filip Hoffmann](https://gitlab.com/folospior) for the wonderful Gleam library.
